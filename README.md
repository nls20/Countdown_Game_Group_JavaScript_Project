JavaScript web application which allows users to play the classic TV game ‘Countdown’. Created multiple games including a letters round, a numbers round and a conundrum round. Users play against the clock to achieve the highest score. Written in JavaScript, with the back-end using Express and MongoDB database, and the front-end using Vue components integrating JavaScript logic, HTML with embedded Vue.js and CSS. We used an existing JSON API to populate our app and Google Charts to display our clock timer.  Worked on project with Brian Bell and Andrew Hunter, mob programming mainly from Brian's code, to increase productivity and get a better understanding of how all the code in the app worked.
